# Deep Person Identification Using Spatiotemporal Facial Motion Amplification

This is the implementation for the paper, "Deep Person Identification Using Spatiotemporal Facial Motion Amplification", ICIP 2020.

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of a new biometric trait, which is based on information extracted through
facial motion amplification. Unlike traditional facial biometric traits, the new biometric does not require the visibility of facial features,
such as the eyes or nose, that are critical in common facial biometric algorithms. In this paper we propose the formation of a spatiotemporal 
facial blood flow map, constructed using small motion amplification. Experiments show that the proposed approach provides significant discriminatory capacity
over different training and testing days and can be potentially used in situations where traditional facial biometrics may not be applicable.
